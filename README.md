# Welcome to Ulord-Sidechain

## About
Ulord-Sidechain a.k.a USC is a Secondary chain for Ulord implemented in java. USC's goal is to provide value and functionality to the Ulord ecosystem by enabling smart-contracts, near instant payment confirmations and higher-scalability. USC  smart contract platform  supports 2-way peg with Ulord that also rewards Ulord miners via merge-mining, allowing them to actively participate in the Smart Contract revolution.
 

## Sidechain techonology  
Sidechain is not specifically referring to a certain chain, but refers to any chain that obeys the rules of the sidechain. The Ulord sidechain rule means that the Ulord sidechain can verify the data from the Ulord main chain, and through the Two-way Peg (2WP), the UlordToken is safely transferred between the mainchains and sidechains at a fixed exchange rate to achieve assets transfer between the chains.  
The Two-way Peg is roughly divided into the following stages:
(1)	Send a 2WP transaction to lock the UlordToken in the main chain;
(2)	Wait for a confirmation period, making the transaction confirmed by enough blocks;
(3)	Transfer the UlordToken to the sidechain and provide proof of SPV or miner's vote;
(4)	Wait for a reorganization period to prevent double spending;
(5)	Unlock the UlordToken for normal use on the sidechain;
